This project presents a real estate website, where are listed, both for buying and for selling. You can check product details, you can add it to your favourites and you have a contact page, where you have to fill in a form and the TopRent team will contact you. In creating this app, i used HTML for the structure, CSS for styling and JavaScript for functionality. I also used the React JavaScript library for creating functional components.
